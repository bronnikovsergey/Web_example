arya
arya’s stitches were crooked again
she frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister sansa sat among the other girls sansa’s needlework was exquisite everyone said so sansa’s work is as pretty as she is septa mordane told their lady mother once she has such fine delicate hands when lady catelyn had asked about arya the septa had sniffed arya has the hands of a blacksmith
arya glanced furtively across the room worried that septa mordane might have read her thoughts but the septa was paying her no attention today she was sitting with the princess myrcella all smiles and admiration it was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts as she had said when the queen brought myrcella to join them arya thought that myrcella’s stitches looked a little crooked too but you would never know it from the way septa mordane was cooing
she studied her own work again looking for some way to salvage it then sighed and put down the needle she looked glumly at her sister sansa was chatting away happily as she worked beth cassel ser rodrik’s little girl was sitting by her feet listening to every word she said and jeyne poole was leaning over to whisper something in her ear
what are you talking about arya asked suddenly
jeyne gave her a startled look then giggled sansa looked abashed beth blushed no one answered
tell me arya said
jeyne glanced over to make certain that septa mordane was not listening myrcella said something then and the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies
we were talking about the prince sansa said her voice soft as a kiss
arya knew which prince she meant joffrey of course the tall handsome one sansa got to sit with him at the feast arya had to sit with the little fat one naturally
joffrey likes your sister jeyne whispered proud as if she had something to do with it she was the daughter of winterfell’s steward and sansa’s dearest friend he told her she was very beautiful
he’s going to marry her little beth said dreamily hugging herself then sansa will be queen of all the realm
sansa had the grace to blush she blushed prettily she did everything prettily arya thought with dull resentment beth you shouldn’t make up stories sansa corrected the younger girl gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her words she looked at arya what did you think of prince joff sister he’s very gallant don’t you think
jon says he looks like a girl arya said
sansa sighed as she stitched poor jon she said he gets jealous because he’s a bastard
he’s our brother arya said much too loudly her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower room
septa mordane raised her eyes she had a bony face sharp eyes and a thin lipless mouth made for frowning it was frowning now what are you talking about children
our half brother sansa corrected soft and precise she smiled for the septa arya and i were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today she said
septa mordane nodded indeed a great honor for us all princess myrcella smiled uncertainly at the compliment arya why aren’t you at work the septa asked she rose to her feet starched skirts rustling as she started across the room let me see your stitches
arya wanted to scream it was just like sansa to go and attract the septa’s attention here she said surrendering up her work
the septa examined the fabric arya arya arya she said this will not do this will not do at all
everyone was looking at her it was too much sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister’s disgrace but jeyne was smirking on her behalf even princess myrcella looked sorry for her arya felt tears filling her eyes she pushed herself out of her chair and bolted for the door
septa mordane called after her arya come back here don’t you take another step your lady mother will hear of this in front of our royal princess too you’ll shame us all
arya stopped at the door and turned back biting her lip the tears were running down her cheeks now she managed a stiff little bow to myrcella by your leave my lady
myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance but if she was uncertain septa mordane was not just where do you think you are going arya the septa demanded
arya glared at her i have to go shoe a horse she said sweetly taking a brief satisfaction in the shock on the septa’s face then she whirled and made her exit running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her
it wasn’t fair sansa had everything sansa was two years older maybe by the time arya had been born there had been nothing left often it felt that way sansa could sew and dance and sing she wrote poetry she knew how to dress she played the high harp and the bells worse she was beautiful sansa had gotten their mother’s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the tullys arya took after their lord father her hair was a lusterless brown and her face was long and solemn jeyne used to call her arya horseface and neigh whenever she came near it hurt that the one thing arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse well that and manage a household sansa had never had much of a head for figures if she did marry prince joff arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward
nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs she bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of arya arya grinned the wolf pup loved her even if no one else did they went everywhere together and nymeria slept in her room at the foot of her bed if mother had not forbidden it arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework let septa mordane complain about her stitches then
nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as arya untied her she had yellow eyes when they caught the sunlight they gleamed like two golden coins arya had named her after the warrior queen of the rhoyne who had led her people across the narrow sea that had been a great scandal too sansa of course had named her pup lady arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight nymeria licked her ear and she giggled
by now septa mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother if she went to her room they would find her arya did not care to be found she had a better notion the boys were at practice in the yard she wanted to see robb put gallant prince joffrey flat on his back come she whispered to nymeria she got up and ran the wolf coming hard at her heels
there was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the great keep where you had a view of the whole yard that was where they headed
they arrived flushed and breathless to find jon seated on the sill one leg drawn up languidly to his chin he was watching the action so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them nymeria stalked closer on wary feet ghost already larger than his litter mates smelled her gave her ear a careful nip and settled back down
jon gave her a curious look shouldn’t you be working on your stitches little sister
arya made a face at him i wanted to see them fight
he smiled come here then
arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below
to her disappointment it was the younger boys drilling bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed and prince tommen who was plump to begin with seemed positively round they were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old ser rodrik cassel the master-at-arms a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers a dozen spectators man and boy were calling out encouragement robb’s voice the loudest among them she spotted theon greyjoy beside him his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his house a look of wry contempt on his face both of the combatants were staggering arya judged that they had been at it awhile
a shade more exhausting than needlework jon observed
a shade more fun than needlework arya gave back at him jon grinned reached over and messed up her hair arya flushed they had always been close jon had their father’s
