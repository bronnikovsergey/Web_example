bran
the morning had dawned clear and cold with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer they set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded twenty in all and bran rode among them nervous with excitement this was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king’s justice done it was the ninth year of summer and the seventh of bran’s life
the man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills robb thought he was a wildling his sword sworn to mance rayder the king-beyond-the-wall it made bran’s skin prickle to think of it he remembered the hearth tales old nan told them the wildlings were cruel men she said slavers and slayers and thieves they consorted with giants and ghouls stole girl children in the dead of night and drank blood from polished horns and their women lay with the others in the long night to sire terrible half-human children
but the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king’s justice was old and scrawny not much taller than robb he had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite and he dressed all in black the same as a brother of the night’s watch except that his furs were ragged and greasy
the breath of man and horse mingled steaming in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them robb and jon sat tall and still on their horses with bran between them on his pony trying to seem older than seven trying to pretend that he’d seen all this before a faint wind blew through the holdfast gate over their heads flapped the banner of the starks of winterfell a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field
bran’s father sat solemnly on his horse long brown hair stirring in the wind his closely trimmed beard was shot with white making him look older than his thirty-five years he had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of heroes and the children of the forest he had taken off father’s face bran thought and donned the face of lord stark of winterfell
there were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning but afterward bran could not recall much of what had been said finally his lord father gave a command and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square they forced his head down onto the hard black wood lord eddard stark dismounted and his ward theon greyjoy brought forth the sword ice that sword was called it was as wide across as a man’s hand and taller even than robb the blade was valyrian steel spell-forged and dark as smoke nothing held an edge like valyrian steel
his father peeled off his gloves and handed them to jory cassel the captain of his household guard he took hold of ice with both hands and said in the name of robert of the house baratheon the first of his name king of the andals and the rhoynar and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm by the word of eddard of the house stark lord of winterfell and warden of the north i do sentence you to die he lifted the greatsword high above his head
bran’s bastard brother jon snow moved closer keep the pony well in hand he whispered and don’t look away father will know if you do
bran kept his pony well in hand and did not look away
his father took off the man’s head with a single sure stroke blood sprayed out across the snow as red as summerwine one of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting bran could not take his eyes off the blood the snows around the stump drank it eagerly reddening as he watched
the head bounced off a thick root and rolled it came up near greyjoy’s feet theon was a lean dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing he laughed put his boot on the head and kicked it away
ass jon muttered low enough so greyjoy did not hear he put a hand on bran’s shoulder and bran looked over at his bastard brother you did well jon told him solemnly jon was fourteen an old hand at justice
it seemed colder on the long ride back to winterfell though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky bran rode with his brothers well ahead of the main party his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses
the deserter died bravely robb said he was big and broad and growing every day with his mother’s coloring the fair skin red-brown hair and blue eyes of the tullys of riverrun he had courage at the least
no jon snow said quietly it was not courage this one was dead of fear you could see it in his eyes stark jon’s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black but there was little they did not see he was of an age with robb but they did not look alike jon was slender where robb was muscular dark where robb was fair graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast
robb was not impressed the others take his eyes he swore he died well race you to the bridge
done jon said kicking his horse forward robb cursed and followed and they galloped off down the trail robb laughing and hooting jon silent and intent the hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went
bran did not try to follow his pony could not keep up he had seen the ragged man’s eyes and he was thinking of them now after a while the sound of robb’s laughter receded and the woods grew silent again
so deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him are you well bran he asked not unkindly
yes father bran told him he looked up wrapped in his furs and leathers mounted on his great warhorse his lord father loomed over him like a giant robb says the man died bravely but jon says he was afraid
what do you think his father asked
bran thought about it can a man still be brave if he’s afraid
that is the only time a man can be brave his father told him do you understand why i did it
he was a wildling bran said they carry off women and sell them to the others
his lord father smiled old nan has been telling you stories again in truth the man was an oathbreaker a deserter from the night’s watch no man is more dangerous the deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken so he will not flinch from any crime no matter how vile but you mistake me the question was not why the man had to die but why i must do it
bran had no answer for that king robert has a headsman he said uncertainly
he does his father admitted as did the targaryen kings before him yet our way is the older way the blood of the first men still flows in the veins of the starks and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword if you would take a man’s life you owe it to him to look into his eyes and hear his final words and if you cannot bear to do that then perhaps the man does not deserve to die
one day bran you will be robb’s bannerman holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king and justice will fall to you when that day comes you must take no pleasure in the task but neither must you look away a ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is
that was when jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them he waved and shouted down at them father bran come quickly see what robb has found then he was gone again
jory rode up beside them trouble my lord
beyond a doubt his lord father said come let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now he sent his horse into a trot jory and bran and the rest came after
they found robb on the riverbank north of the bridge with jon still mounted beside him the late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn robb stood knee-deep in white his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair he was cradling something in his arm while the boys talked in hushed excited voices
the riders picked their way carefully through the drifts groping for solid footing on the hidden uneven ground jory cassel and theon greyjoy were the first to reach the boys greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode bran heard the breath go out of him gods he exclaimed struggling
