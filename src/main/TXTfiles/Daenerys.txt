daenerys
her brother held the gown up for her inspection
this is beauty touch it go on caress the fabric
dany touched it the cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water she could not remember ever wearing anything so soft it frightened her she pulled her hand away is it really mine
a gift from the magister illyrio viserys said smiling her brother was in a high mood tonight the color will bring out the violet in your eyes and you shall have gold as well and jewels of all sorts illyrio has promised tonight you must look like a princess
a princess dany thought she had forgotten what that was like perhaps she had never really known why does he give us so much she asked what does he want from us for nigh on half a year they had lived in the magister’s house eating his food pampered by his servants dany was thirteen old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price here in the free city of pentos
illyrio is no fool viserys said he was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes the magister knows that i will not forget my friends when i come into my throne
dany said nothing magister illyrio was a dealer in spices gemstones dragonbone and other less savory things he had friends in all of the nine free cities it was said and even beyond in vaes dothrak and the fabled lands beside the jade sea it was also said that he’d never had a friend he wouldn’t cheerfully sell for the right price dany listened to the talk in the streets and she heard these things but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream his anger was a terrible thing when roused viserys called it waking the dragon
her brother hung the gown beside the door illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you be sure you wash off the stink of the stables khal drogo has a thousand horses tonight he looks for a different sort of mount he studied her critically you still slouch straighten yourself he pushed back her shoulders with his hands let them see that you have a woman’s shape now his fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple you will not fail me tonight if you do it will go hard for you you don’t want to wake the dragon do you his fingers twisted her the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic do you he repeated
no dany said meekly
her brother smiled good he touched her hair almost with affection when they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say that it began tonight
when he was gone dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay the square brick towers of pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate for a moment she wished she could be out there with them barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters with no past and no future and no feast to attend at khal drogo’s manse
somewhere beyond the sunset across the narrow sea lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords the dothraki called that land rhaesh andahli the land of the andals in the free cities they talked of westeros and the sunset kingdoms her brother had a simpler name our land he called it the words were like a prayer with him if he said them enough the gods were sure to hear ours by blood right taken from us by treachery but ours still ours forever you do not steal from the dragon oh no the dragon remembers
and perhaps the dragon did remember but dany could not she had never seen this land her brother said was theirs this realm beyond the narrow sea these places he talked of casterly rock and the eyrie highgarden and the vale of arryn dorne and the isle of faces they were just words to her viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled king’s landing to escape the advancing armies of the usurper but daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother’s womb
yet sometimes dany would picture the way it had been so often had her brother told her the stories the midnight flight to dragonstone moonlight shimmering on the ship’s black sails her brother rhaegar battling the usurper in the bloody waters of the trident and dying for the woman he loved the sack of king’s landing by the ones viserys called the usurper’s dogs the lords lannister and stark princess elia of dorne pleading for mercy as rhaegar’s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes the polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the kingslayer opened father’s throat with a golden sword
she had been born on dragonstone nine moons after their flight while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart they said that storm was terrible the targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea her mother had died birthing her and for that her brother viserys had never forgiven her
she did not remember dragonstone either they had run again just before the usurper’s brother set sail with his new-built fleet by then only dragonstone itself the ancient seat of their house had remained of the seven kingdoms that had once been theirs it would not remain for long the garrison had been prepared to sell them to the usurper but one night ser willem darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both along with her wet nurse and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the braavosian coast
she remembered ser willem dimly a great grey bear of a man half-blind roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed the servants had lived in terror of him but he had always been kind to dany he called her little princess and sometimes my lady and his hands were soft as old leather he never left his bed though and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night a hot moist sickly sweet odor that was when they lived in braavos in the big house with the red door dany had her own room there with a lemon tree outside her window after ser willem had died the servants had stolen what little money they had left and soon after they had been put out of the big house dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever
they had wandered since then from braavos to myr from myr to tyrosh and on to qohor and volantis and lys never staying long in any one place her brother would not allow it the usurper’s hired knives were close behind them he insisted though dany had never seen one
at first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last targaryens to their homes and tables but as the years passed and the usurper continued to sit upon the iron throne doors closed and their lives grew meaner years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures and now even the coin they had gotten from mother’s crown had gone in the alleys and wine sinks of pentos they called her brother the beggar king dany did not want to know what they called her
we will have it all back someday sweet sister he would promise her sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it the jewels and the silks dragonstone and king’s landing the iron throne and the seven kingdoms all they have taken from us we will have it back viserys lived for that day all that daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door the lemon tree outside her window the childhood she had never known
there came a soft knock on her door come dany said turning away from the window illyrio’s servants entered bowed and set about their business they were slaves a gift from one of the magister’s many dothraki friends there was no slavery in the free city of pentos nonetheless they were slaves the old woman small and grey as a mouse never said a word but the girl made up for it she was illyrio’s favorite a fair-haired
