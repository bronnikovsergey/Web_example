eddard
the visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel three hundred strong a pride of bannermen and knights of sworn swords and freeriders over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind emblazoned with the crowned stag of baratheon
ned knew many of the riders there came ser jaime lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold and there sandor clegane with his terrible burned face the tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince and that stunted little man behind them was surely the imp tyrion lannister
yet the huge man at the head of the column flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the kingsguard seemed almost a stranger to ned  until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug ned ah but it is good to see that frozen face of yours the king looked him over top to bottom and laughed you have not changed at all
would that ned had been able to say the same fifteen years past when they had ridden forth to win a throne the lord of storm’s end had been clean-shaven clear-eyed and muscled like a maiden’s fantasy six and a half feet tall he towered over lesser men and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his house he became a veritable giant he’d had a giant’s strength too his weapon of choice a spiked iron warhammer that ned could scarcely lift in those days the smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume
now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume and he had a girth to match his height ned had last seen the king nine years before during balon greyjoy’s rebellion when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed king of the iron islands since the night they had stood side by side in greyjoy’s fallen stronghold where robert had accepted the rebel lord’s surrender and ned had taken his son theon as hostage and ward the king had gained at least eight stone a beard as coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls but nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes
yet robert was ned’s king now and not just a friend so he said only your grace winterfell is yours
by then the others were dismounting as well and grooms were coming forward for their mounts robert’s queen cersei lannister entered on foot with her younger children the wheelhouse in which they had ridden a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses was too wide to pass through the castle gate ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen’s ring while robert embraced catelyn like a long-lost sister then the children had been brought forward introduced and approved of by both sides
no sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host take me down to your crypt eddard i would pay my respects
ned loved him for that for remembering her still after all these years he called for a lantern no other words were needed the queen had begun to protest they had been riding since dawn everyone was tired and cold surely they should refresh themselves first the dead would wait she had said no more than that robert had looked at her and her twin brother jaime had taken her quietly by the arm and she had said no more
they went down to the crypt together ned and this king he scarcely recognized the winding stone steps were narrow ned went first with the lantern i was starting to think we would never reach winterfell robert complained as they descended in the south the way they talk about my seven kingdoms a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined
i trust you enjoyed the journey your grace
robert snorted bogs and forests and fields and scarcely a decent inn north of the neck i’ve never seen such a vast emptiness where are all your people
likely they were too shy to come out ned jested he could feel the chill coming up the stairs a cold breath from deep within the earth kings are a rare sight in the north
robert snorted more likely they were hiding under the snow snow ned the king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended
late summer snows are common enough ned said i hope they did not trouble you they are usually mild
the others take your mild snows robert swore what will this place be like in winter i shudder to think
the winters are hard ned admitted but the starks will endure we always have
you need to come south robert told him you need a taste of summer before it flees in highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see the fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth — melons peaches fireplums you’ve never tasted such sweetness you’ll see i brought you some even at storm’s end with that good wind off the bay the days are so hot you can barely move and you ought to see the towns ned flowers everywhere the markets bursting with food the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air everyone is fat and drunk and rich he laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump and the girls ned he exclaimed his eyes sparkling i swear women lose all modesty in the heat they swim naked in the river right beneath the castle even in the streets it’s too damn hot for wool or fur so they go around in these short gowns silk if they have the silver and cotton if not but it’s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin they might as well be naked the king laughed happily
robert baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites a man who knew how to take his pleasures that was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of eddard stark yet ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom of the stairs his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of the crypt
your grace ned said respectfully he swept the lantern in a wide semicircle shadows moved and lurched flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched ahead two by two into the dark between the pillars the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal remains she is down at the end with father and brandon
he led the way between the pillars and robert followed wordlessly shivering in the subterranean chill it was always cold down here their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of house stark the lords of winterfell watched them pass their likenesses were carved into the stones that sealed the tombs in long rows they sat blind eyes staring out into eternal darkness while great stone direwolves curled round their feet the shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by
by ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been lord of winterfell to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts the oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing leaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the castle now he hoped not the first lords of winterfell had been men hard as the land they ruled in the centuries before the dragonlords came over the sea they had sworn allegiance to no man styling themselves the kings in the north
ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern the crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed black holes waiting for their dead waiting for him and his children ned did not like to think on that here he told his king
robert nodded silently knelt and bowed his head
there were three tombs side by side lord rickard stark ned’s father had a long stern face the stonemason had known him well he sat with quiet dignity stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap but in life all swords had failed him in two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children
brandon had been twenty when he died strangled by order of the mad king aerys targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed catelyn tully of riverrun his father had been forced to watch him die he was the true heir the eldest born to rule
lyanna had only been sixteen a child-woman of surpassing loveliness ned had loved her with all his heart robert had loved her even more she was to have been his bride
she was more beautiful than that the king said after a silence his eyes lingered on lyanna’s face as if he could will her back to life finally he rose made awkward by his weight ah damn it ned did you have to bury her in a place like this his voice was hoarse with remembered grief she deserved more than darkness 
she was a stark of winterfell ned said quietly this is her place
she should be on a hill somewhere under a fruit tree with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean
i was with her when she died ned reminded the king she wanted to come home to rest beside brandon and father he could hear her still at times promise me she had cried in a room that smelled of blood and roses promise me ned the fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper but when he gave her his word the fear had gone out of his sister’s eyes ned remembered the way she had smiled then how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life the rose petals spilling from her palm dead and black after that he remembered nothing they had found him still holding her body silent with grief the little crannogman howland reed had taken her hand from his ned could recall none of it i bring her flowers when i can he said lyanna was  fond of flowers
the king touched her cheek his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh i vowed to kill rhaegar for what he did to her
you did ned reminded him
only once robert said bitterly
they had come together at the ford of the trident while the battle crashed around them robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm the targaryen prince armored all in black on his breastplate was the three-headed dragon of his house wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight the waters of the trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed again and again until at last a crushing blow from robert’s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it when ned had finally come on the scene rhaegar lay dead in the stream while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor
in my dreams i kill him every night robert admitted a thousand deaths will still be less than he deserves
there was nothing ned could say to that after a quiet he said we should return your grace your wife will be waiting
the others take my wife robert muttered sourly but he started back the way they had come his footsteps falling heavily and if i hear ‘your grace’ once more i’ll have your head on a spike we are more to each other than that
i had not forgotten ned replied quietly when the king did not answer he said tell me about jon
robert shook his head i have never seen a man sicken so quickly we gave a tourney on my son’s name day if you had seen jon then you would have sworn he would live forever a fortnight later he was dead the sickness was like a fire in his gut it burned right through him he paused beside a pillar before the tomb of a long-dead stark i loved that old man
we both did ned paused a moment catelyn fears for her sister how does lysa bear her grief
robert’s mouth gave a bitter twist not well in truth he admitted i think losing jon has driven the woman mad ned she has taken the boy back to the eyrie against my wishes i had hoped to foster him with tywin lannister at casterly rock jon had no brothers no other sons was i supposed to leave him to be raised by women
ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to lord tywin but he left his doubts unspoken some old wounds never truly heal and bleed again at the slightest word the wife has lost the husband he said carefully perhaps the mother feared to lose the son the boy is very young
six and sickly and lord of the eyrie gods have mercy the king swore lord tywin had never taken a ward before lysa ought to have been honored the lannisters are a great and noble house she refused to even hear of it then she left in the dead of night without so much as a by-your-leave cersei was furious he sighed deeply the boy is my namesake did you know that robert arryn i am sworn to protect him how can i do that if his mother steals him away
i will take him as ward if you wish ned said lysa should consent to that she and catelyn were close as girls and she would be welcome here as well
a generous offer my friend the king said but too late lord tywin has already given his consent fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him
i have more concern for my nephew’s welfare than i do for lannister pride ned declared
that is because you do not sleep with a lannister robert laughed the sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling his smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard ah ned he said you are still too serious he put a massive arm around ned’s shoulders i had planned to wait a few days to speak to you but i see now there’s no need for it come walk with me
they started back down between the pillars blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed the king kept his arm around ned’s shoulder you must have wondered why i finally came north to winterfell after so long
ned had his suspicions but he did not give them voice for the joy of my company surely he said lightly and there is the wall you need to see it your grace to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it the night’s watch is a shadow of what it once was benjen says—
no doubt i will hear what your brother says soon enough robert said the wall has stood for what eight thousand years it can keep a few days more i have more pressing concerns these are difficult times i need good men about me men like jon arryn he served as lord of the eyrie as warden of the east as the hand of the king he will not be easy to replace
his son  ned began
his son will succeed to the eyrie and all its incomes robert said brusquely no more
that took ned by surprise he stopped startled and turned to look at his king the words came unbidden the arryns have always been wardens of the east the title goes with the domain
perhaps when he comes of age the honor can be restored to him robert said i have this year to think of and next a six-year-old boy is no war leader ned
in peace the title is only an honor let the boy keep it for his father’s sake if not his own surely you owe jon that much for his service
the king was not pleased he took his arm from around ned’s shoulders jon’s service was the duty he owed his liege lord i am not ungrateful ned you of all men ought to know that but the son is not the father a mere boy cannot hold the east then his tone softened enough of this there is a more important office to discuss and i would not argue with you robert grasped ned by the elbow i have need of you ned
i am yours to command your grace always they were words he had to say and so he said them apprehensive about what might come next
robert scarcely seemed to hear him those years we spent in the eyrie  gods those were good years i want you at my side again ned i want you down in king’s landing not up here at the end of the world where you are no damned use to anybody robert looked off into the darkness for a moment as melancholy as a stark i swear to you sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse and the people  there is no end of them i sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw they all want something money or land or justice the lies they tell  and my lords and ladies are no better i am surrounded by
