jon
there were times — not many but a few — when jon snow was glad he was a bastard as he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon it struck him that this might be one of them
he settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank the sweet fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips
the great hall of winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and fresh-baked bread its grey stone walls were draped with banners white gold crimson the direwolf of stark baratheon’s crowned stag the lion of lannister a singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire the clangor of pewter plates and cups and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations
it was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king jon’s brothers and sisters had been seated with the royal children beneath the raised platform where lord and lady stark hosted the king and queen in honor of the occasion his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine but no more than that down here on the benches there was no one to stop jon drinking as much as he had a thirst for
and he was finding that he had a man’s thirst to the raucous delight of the youths around him who urged him on every time he drained a glass they were fine company and jon relished the stories they were telling tales of battle and bedding and the hunt he was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the king’s offspring he had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their entrance the procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench and jon had gotten a good long look at them all
his lord father had come first escorting the queen she was as beautiful as men said a jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes his father helped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat but the queen never so much as looked at him even at fourteen jon could see through her smile
next had come king robert himself with lady stark on his arm the king was a great disappointment to jon his father had talked of him often the peerless robert baratheon demon of the trident the fiercest warrior of the realm a giant among princes jon saw only a fat man red-faced under his beard sweating through his silks he walked like a man half in his cups
after them came the children little rickon first managing the long walk with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit close behind came robb in grey wool trimmed with white the stark colors he had the princess myrcella on his arm she was a wisp of a girl not quite eight her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net jon noticed the shy looks she gave robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him he decided she was insipid robb didn’t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was he was grinning like a fool
his half sisters escorted the royal princes arya was paired with plump young tommen whose white-blond hair was longer than hers sansa two years older drew the crown prince joffrey baratheon he was twelve younger than jon or robb but taller than either to jon’s vast dismay prince joffrey had his sister’s hair and his mother’s deep green eyes a thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past his golden choker and high velvet collar sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him but jon did not like joffrey’s pouty lips or the bored disdainful way he looked at winterfell’s great hall
he was more interested in the pair that came behind him the queen’s brothers the lannisters of casterly rock the lion and the imp there was no mistaking which was which ser jaime lannister was twin to queen cersei tall and golden with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife he wore crimson silk high black boots a black satin cloak on the breast of his tunic the lion of his house was embroidered in gold thread roaring its defiance they called him the lion of lannister to his face and whispered kingslayer behind his back
jon found it hard to look away from him this is what a king should look like he thought to himself as the man passed
then he saw the other one waddling along half-hidden by his brother’s side tyrion lannister the youngest of lord tywin’s brood and by far the ugliest all that the gods had given to cersei and jaime they had denied tyrion he was a dwarf half his brother’s height struggling to keep pace on stunted legs his head was too large for his body with a brute’s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow one green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white jon watched him with fascination
the last of the high lords to enter were his uncle benjen stark of the night’s watch and his father’s ward young theon greyjoy benjen gave jon a warm smile as he went by theon ignored him utterly but there was nothing new in that after all had been seated toasts were made thanks were given and returned and then the feasting began
jon had started drinking then and he had not stopped
something rubbed against his leg beneath the table jon saw red eyes staring up at him hungry again he asked there was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table jon reached out to tear off a leg then had a better idea he knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs ghost ripped into it in savage silence his brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their wolves to the banquet but there were more curs than jon could count at this end of the hall and no one had said a word about his pup he told himself he was fortunate in that too
his eyes stung jon rubbed at them savagely cursing the smoke he swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken
dogs moved between the tables trailing after the serving girls one of them a black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes caught a scent of the chicken she stopped and edged under the bench to get a share jon watched the confrontation the bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer ghost looked up silent and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes the bitch snapped an angry challenge she was three times the size of the direwolf pup ghost did not move he stood over his prize and opened his mouth baring his fangs the bitch tensed barked again then thought better of this fight she turned and slunk away with one last defiant snap to save her pride ghost went back to his meal
jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur the direwolf looked up at him nipped gently at his hand then went back to eating
is this one of the direwolves i’ve heard so much of a familiar voice asked close at hand
jon looked up happily as his uncle ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as jon had ruffled the wolf’s yes he said his name is ghost
one of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he’d been telling to make room at the table for their lord’s brother benjen stark straddled the bench with long legs and took the wine cup out of jon’s hand summerwine he said after a taste nothing so sweet how many cups have you had jon
jon smiled
ben stark laughed as i feared ah well i believe i was younger than you the first time i got truly and sincerely drunk he snagged a roasted onion dripping brown with gravy from a nearby trencher and bit into it it crunched
his uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag but there was always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes he dressed in black as befitted a man of the night’s watch tonight it was rich black velvet with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle a heavy silver chain was looped round his neck benjen watched ghost with amusement as he ate his onion a very quiet wolf he observed
he’s not like the others jon said he never makes a sound that’s why i named him ghost that and because he’s white the others are all dark grey or black
there are still direwolves beyond the wall we hear them on our rangings benjen stark gave jon a long look don’t you usually eat at table with your brothers
most times jon answered in a flat voice but tonight lady stark thought it might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them
i see his uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall my brother does not seem very festive tonight
jon had noticed that too a bastard had to learn to notice things to read the truth that people hid behind their eyes his father was observing all the courtesies but there was tightness in him that jon had seldom seen before he said little looking out over the hall with hooded eyes seeing nothing two seats away the king had been drinking heavily all night his broad face was flushed behind his great black beard he made many a toast laughed loudly at every jest and attacked each dish like a starving man but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice sculpture the queen is angry too jon told his uncle in a low quiet voice father took the king down to the crypts this afternoon the queen didn’t want him to go
benjen gave jon a careful measuring look you don’t miss much do you jon we could use a man like you on the wall
jon swelled with pride robb is a stronger lance than i am but i’m the better sword and hullen says i sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle
notable achievements
take me with you when you go back to the wall jon said in a sudden rush father will give me leave to go if you ask him i know he will
uncle benjen studied his face carefully the wall is a hard place for a boy jon
i am almost a man grown jon protested i will turn fifteen on my next name day and maester luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children
that’s true enough benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth he took jon’s cup from the table filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher and drank down a long swallow
daeren targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered dorne jon said the young dragon was one of his heroes
a conquest that lasted a summer his uncle pointed out your boy king lost ten thousand men taking the place and another fifty trying to hold it someone should have told him that war isn’t a game he took another sip of wine also he said wiping his mouth daeren targaryen was only eighteen when he died or have you forgotten that part
i forget nothing jon boasted the wine was making him bold he tried to sit very straight to make himself seem taller i want to serve in the night’s watch uncle
he had thought on it long and hard lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him robb would someday inherit winterfell would command great armies as the warden of the north bran and rickon would be robb’s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name his sisters arya and sansa would marry the heirs of other great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own but what place could a bastard hope to earn
you don’t know what you’re asking jon the night’s watch is a sworn brotherhood we have no families none of us will ever father sons our wife is duty our mistress is honor
a bastard can have honor too jon said i am ready to swear your oath
you are a boy of fourteen benjen said not a man not yet until you have known a woman you cannot understand what you would be giving up
i don’t care about that jon said hotly
you might if you knew what it meant benjen said if you knew what the oath would cost you you might be less eager to pay the price son
jon felt anger rise inside him i’m not your son
benjen stark stood up more’s the pity he put a hand on jon’s shoulder come back to me after you’ve fathered a few bastards of your own and we’ll see how you feel
jon trembled i will never father a bastard he said carefully never he spat it out like venom
suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent and they were all looking at him he felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes he pushed himself to his feet
i must be excused he said with the last of his dignity he whirled and bolted before they could see him cry he must have drunk more wine than he had realized his feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor laughter boomed all around him and jon felt hot tears on his cheeks someone tried to steady him he wrenched free of their grip and ran half-blind for the door ghost followed close at his heels out into the night
the yard was quiet and empty a lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold he looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone but jon would have traded places with him in an instant otherwise the castle was dark and deserted jon had seen an abandoned holdfast once a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there winterfell reminded him of that tonight
the sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him they were the last things jon wanted to hear he wiped away his tears on the sleeve of his shirt furious that he had let them fall and turned to go
boy a voice called out to him jon turned
tyrion lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the great hall looking for all the world like a gargoyle the dwarf grinned down at him is that animal a wolf
a direwolf jon said his name is ghost he stared up at the little man his disappointment suddenly forgotten what are you doing up there why aren’t you at the feast
too hot too noisy and i’d drunk too much wine the dwarf told him i learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother might i have a closer look at your wolf
jon hesitated then nodded slowly can you climb down or shall i bring a ladder
oh bleed that the little man said he pushed himself off the ledge into empty air jon gasped then watched with awe as tyrion lannister spun around in a tight ball landed lightly on his hands then vaulted backward onto his legs
ghost backed away from him uncertainly
the dwarf dusted himself off and laughed i believe i’ve frightened your wolf my apologies
he’s not scared jon said he knelt and called out ghost come here come on that’s it
the wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at jon’s face but he kept a wary eye on tyrion lannister and when the dwarf reached out to pet him he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl shy isn’t he lannister observed
sit ghost jon commanded that’s it keep still he looked up at the dwarf you can touch him now he won’t move until i tell him to i’ve been training him
i see lannister said he ruffled the snow-white fur between ghost’s ears and said nice wolf
if i wasn’t here he’d tear out your throat jon said it wasn’t actually true yet but it would be
in that case you had best stay close the dwarf said he cocked his oversized head to one side and looked jon over with his mismatched eyes i am tyrion lannister
i know jon said he rose standing he was taller than the dwarf it made him feel strange
you’re ned stark’s bastard aren’t you
jon felt a coldness pass right through him he pressed his lips together and said nothing
did i offend you lannister said sorry dwarfs don’t have to be tactful generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head he grinned you are the bastard though
lord eddard stark is my father jon admitted stiffly
lannister studied his face yes he said i can see it you have more of the north in you than your brothers
half brothers jon corrected he was pleased by the dwarf’s comment but he tried not to let it show
let me give you some counsel bastard lannister said never forget what you are for surely the world will not make it your strength then it can never be your weakness armor yourself in it and it will never be used to hurt you
jon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel what do you know about being a bastard
all dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes
you are your mother’s trueborn son
