sansa
eddard stark had left before dawn septa mordane informed sansa as they broke their fast the king sent for him another hunt i do believe there are still wild aurochs in these lands i am told
i’ve never seen an aurochs sansa said feeding a piece of bacon to lady under the table the direwolf took it from her hand as delicate as a queen
septa mordane sniffed in disapproval a noble lady does not feed dogs at her table she said breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread
she’s not a dog she’s a direwolf sansa pointed out as lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue anyway father said we could keep them with us if we want
the septa was not appeased you’re a good girl sansa but i do vow when it comes to that creature you’re as willful as your sister arya she scowled and where is arya this morning
she wasn’t hungry sansa said knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook’s boy
do remind her to dress nicely today the grey velvet perhaps we are all invited to ride with the queen and princess myrcella in the royal wheelhouse and we must look our best
sansa already looked her best she had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone and picked her nicest blue silks she had been looking forward to today for more than a week it was a great honor to ride with the queen and besides prince joffrey might be there her betrothed just thinking it made her feel a strange fluttering inside even though they were not to marry for years and years sansa did not really know joffrey yet but she was already in love with him he was all she ever dreamt her prince should be tall and handsome and strong with hair like gold she treasured every chance to spend time with him few as they were the only thing that scared her about today was arya arya had a way of ruining everything you never knew what she would do i’ll tell her sansa said uncertainly but she’ll dress the way she always does she hoped it wouldn’t be too embarrassing may i be excused
you may septa mordane helped herself to more bread and honey and sansa slid from the bench lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn’s common room
outside she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day’s march the inn was a sprawling three-story structure of pale stone the biggest that sansa had ever seen but even so it had accommodations for less than a third of the king’s party which had swollen to more than four hundred with the addition of her father’s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road
she found arya on the banks of the trident trying to hold nymeria still while she brushed dried mud from her fur the direwolf was not enjoying the process arya was wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day before
you better put on something pretty sansa told her septa mordane said so we’re traveling in the queen’s wheelhouse with princess myrcella today
i’m not arya said trying to brush a tangle out of nymeria’s matted grey fur mycah and i are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford
rubies sansa said lost what rubies
arya gave her a look like she was so stupid rhaegar’s rubies this is where king robert killed him and won the crown
sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief you can’t look for rubies the princess is expecting us the queen invited us both
i don’t care arya said the wheelhouse doesn’t even have windows you can’t see a thing
what could you want to see sansa said annoyed she had been thrilled by the invitation and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything just as she’d feared it’s all just fields and farms and holdfasts
it is not arya said stubbornly if you came with us sometimes you’d see
i hate riding sansa said fervently all it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore
arya shrugged hold still she snapped at nymeria i’m not hurting you then to sansa she said when we were crossing the neck i counted thirty-six flowers i never saw before and mycah showed me a lizard-lion
sansa shuddered they had been twelve days crossing the neck rumbling down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog and she had hated every moment of it the air had been damp and clammy the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night they had to stop right on the kingsroad dense thickets of half-drowned trees pressed close around them branches dripping with curtains of pale fungus huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them there were quicksands waiting to suck you down and snakes watching from the trees and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water like black logs with eyes and teeth
none of which stopped arya of course one day she came back grinning her horsey grin her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for father sansa kept hoping he would tell arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be but he never did he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers that just made her worse
then it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses and arya got a rash on her arms sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson but arya laughed about it and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend mycah told her it would stop the itching she had bruises on her arms and shoulders too dark purple welts and faded green-and-yellow splotches sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep how she had gotten those only the seven gods knew
arya was still going on brushing out nymeria’s tangles and chattering about things she’d seen on the trek south last week we found this haunted watchtower and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses you should have seen them run when they caught a scent of nymeria the wolf wriggled in her grasp and arya scolded her stop that i have to do the other side you’re all muddy
you’re not supposed to leave the column sansa reminded her father said so
arya shrugged i didn’t go far anyway nymeria was with me the whole time i don’t always go off either sometimes it’s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people
sansa knew all about the sorts of people arya liked to talk to squires and grooms and serving girls old men and naked children rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth arya would make friends with anybody this mycah was the worst a butcher’s boy thirteen and wild he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the slaughtering block just the sight of him was enough to make sansa feel sick but arya seemed to prefer his company to hers
sansa was running out of patience now you have to come with me she told her sister firmly you can’t refuse the queen septa mordane will expect you
arya ignored her she gave a hard yank with the brush nymeria growled and spun away affronted come back here
there’s going to be lemon cakes and tea sansa went on all adult and reasonable lady brushed against her leg sansa scratched her ears the way she liked and lady sat beside her on her haunches watching arya chase nymeria why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen
i don’t like the queen arya said casually sansa sucked in her breath shocked that even arya would say such a thing but her sister prattled on heedless she won’t even let me bring nymeria she thrust the brush under her belt and stalked her wolf nymeria watched her approach warily
a royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf sansa said and princess myrcella is afraid of them you know that
myrcella is a little baby arya grabbed nymeria around her neck but the moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off frustrated arya threw down the brush bad wolf she shouted
sansa couldn’t help but smile a little the kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master she gave lady a quick little hug lady licked her cheek sansa giggled arya heard and whirled around glaring i don’t care what you say i’m going out riding her long horsey face got the stubborn look that meant she was going to do something willful
gods be true arya sometimes you act like such a child sansa said i’ll go by myself then it will be ever so much nicer that way lady and i will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without you
she turned to walk off but arya shouted after her they won’t let you bring lady either she was gone before sansa could think of a reply chasing nymeria along the river
alone and humiliated sansa took the long way back to the inn where she knew septa mordane would be waiting lady padded quietly by her side she was almost in tears all she wanted was for things to be nice and pretty the way they were in the songs why couldn’t arya be sweet and delicate and kind like princess myrcella she would have liked a sister like that
sansa could never understand how two sisters born only two years apart could be so different it would have been easier if arya had been a bastard like their half brother jon she even looked like jon with the long face and brown hair of the starks and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring and jon’s mother had been common or so people whispered once when she was littler sansa had even asked mother if perhaps there hadn’t been some mistake perhaps the grumkins had stolen her real sister but mother had only laughed and said no arya was her daughter and sansa’s trueborn sister blood of their blood sansa could not think why mother would want to lie about it so she supposed it had to be true
as she neared the center of camp her distress was quickly forgotten a crowd had gathered around the queen’s wheelhouse sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees the doors had been thrown open she saw and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps smiling down at someone she heard her saying the council does us great honor my good lords
what’s happening she asked a squire she knew
the council sent riders from king’s landing to escort us the rest of the way he told her an honor guard for the king
anxious to see sansa let lady clear a path through the crowd people moved aside hastily for the direwolf when she got closer she saw two knights kneeling before the queen in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink
one knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun when he removed his helm sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his armor yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that from his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the kingsguard
his companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green he was the handsomest man sansa had ever set eyes upon tall and powerfully made with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face and laughing green eyes to match his armor cradled under one arm was an antlered helm its magnificent rack shimmering in gold
at first sansa did not notice the third stranger he did not kneel with the others he stood to one side beside their horses a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence his face was pockmarked and beardless with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks though he was not an old man only a few wisps of hair remained to him sprouting above his ears but those he had grown long as a woman’s his armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather plain and unadorned and it spoke of age and hard use above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible a two-handed greatsword too long to be worn at his side
the king is gone hunting but i know he will be pleased to see you when he returns the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her but sansa could not take her eyes off the third man he seemed to feel the weight of her gaze slowly he turned his head lady growled a terror as overwhelming as anything sansa stark had ever felt filled her suddenly she stepped backward and bumped into someone
strong hands grasped her by the shoulders and for a moment sansa thought it was her father but when she turned it was the burned face of sandor clegane looking down at her his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile you are shaking girl he said his voice rasping do i frighten you so much
he did and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other still sansa wrenched away from him and the hound laughed and lady moved between them rumbling a warning sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms around the wolf they were all gathered around gaping she could feel their eyes on her and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter
a wolf a man said and someone else said seven hells that’s a direwolf and the first man said what’s it doing in camp and the hound’s rasping voice replied the starks use them for wet nurses and sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on her and lady swords in their hands and then she was frightened again and ashamed tears filled her eyes
she heard the queen say joffrey go to her
and her prince was there
leave her alone joffrey said he stood over her beautiful in blue wool and black leather his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown he gave her his hand drew her to her feet what is it sweet lady why are you afraid no one will hurt you put away your swords all of you the wolf is her little pet that’s all he looked at sandor clegane and you dog away with you you’re scaring my betrothed
the hound ever faithful bowed and slid away quietly through the press sansa struggled to steady herself she felt like such a fool she was a stark of winterfell a noble lady and someday she would be a queen it was not him my sweet prince she tried to explain it was the other one
the two stranger knights exchanged a look payne chuckled the young man in the green armor
the older man in white spoke to sansa gently ofttimes ser ilyn frightens me as well sweet lady he has a fearsome aspect
as well he should the queen had descended from the wheelhouse the spectators parted to make way for her if the wicked do not fear the king’s justice you have put the wrong man in the office
sansa finally found her words then surely you have chosen the right one your grace she said and a gale of laughter erupted all around her
well spoken child said the old man in white as befits the daughter of eddard stark i am honored to know you however irregular the manner of our meeting i am ser barristan selmy of the kingsguard he bowed
sansa knew the name and now the courtesies that septa mordane had taught her over the years came back to her the lord commander of the kingsguard she said and councillor to robert our king and to aerys targaryen before him the honor is mine good knight even in the far north the singers praise the deeds of barristan the bold
the green knight laughed again barristan the old you mean don’t flatter him too sweetly child he thinks overmuch of himself already he smiled at her now wolf girl if you can put a name to me as well then i must concede that you are truly our hand’s daughter
joffrey stiffened beside her have a care how you address my betrothed
i can answer sansa said quickly to quell her prince’s anger she smiled at the green knight your helmet bears golden antlers my lord the stag is the sigil of the royal house king robert has two brothers by your extreme youth you can only be renly baratheon lord of storm’s end and councillor to the king and so i name you
ser barristan chuckled by his extreme youth he can only be a prancing jackanapes and so i name him
there was general laughter led by lord renly himself the tension of a few moments ago was gone and sansa was beginning to feel comfortable  until ser ilyn payne shouldered two men aside and stood before her unsmiling he did not say a word lady bared her teeth and began to growl a low rumble full of menace but this time sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head i am sorry if i offended you ser ilyn she said
she waited for an answer but none came as the headsman looked at her his pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her and then the skin leaving her soul naked before him still silent he turned and walked away
sansa did not understand she looked at her prince did i say something wrong your grace why will he not speak to me
ser ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years lord renly commented with a sly smile
joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing then took sansa’s hands in his own aerys targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers
he speaks most eloquently with his sword however the queen said and his devotion to our realm is unquestioned then she smiled graciously and said sansa the good councillors and i must speak together until the king returns with your father i fear we shall have to postpone your day with myrcella please give your sweet sister my apologies joffrey perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our guest today
it would be my pleasure mother joffrey said very formally he took her by the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse and sansa’s spirits took flight a whole day with her prince she gazed at joffrey worshipfully he was so gallant she thought the way he had rescued her from ser ilyn and the hound why it was almost like the songs like the time serwyn of the mirror shield saved the princess daeryssa from the giants or prince aemon the dragonknight championing queen naerys’s honor against evil ser morgil’s slanders
the touch of joffrey’s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster what would you like to do
be with you sansa thought but she said whatever you’d like to do my prince
joffrey reflected a moment we could go riding
oh i love riding sansa said
joffrey glanced back at lady who was following at their heels your wolf is liable to frighten the horses and my dog seems to frighten you let us leave them both behind and set off on our own what do you say
sansa hesitated if you like she said uncertainly i suppose i could tie lady up she did not quite understand though i didn’t know you had a dog 
joffrey laughed he’s my mother’s dog in truth she has set him to guard me and so he does
you mean the hound she said she wanted to hit herself for being so slow her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid is it safe to leave him behind
prince joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask have no fear lady i am almost a man grown and i don’t fight with wood like your brothers all i need is this he drew his sword and showed it to her a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve gleaming blue steel castle-forged and double-edged with a leather grip and a lion’s-head pommel in gold sansa exclaimed over it admiringly and joffrey looked pleased i call it lion’s tooth he said
and so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them while they ranged east along the north bank of the trident with no company save lion’s tooth
it was a glorious day a magical day the air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers and the woods here had a gentle beauty that sansa had never seen in the north prince joffrey’s mount was a blood bay courser swift as the wind and he rode it with reckless abandon so fast that sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on her mare it was a day for adventures they explored the caves by the riverbank and tracked a shadowcat to its lair and when they grew hungry joffrey found a holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady they dined on trout fresh from the river and sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before my father only lets us have one cup and only at feasts she confessed to her prince
my betrothed can drink as much as she wants joffrey said refilling her cup
they went more slowly after they had eaten joffrey sang for her as they rode his voice high and sweet and pure sansa was a little dizzy from the wine shouldn’t we be starting back she asked
soon joffrey said the battleground is right up ahead where the river bends that was where my father killed rhaegar targaryen you know he smashed in his chest crunch right through the armor joffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done then my uncle jaime killed old aerys and my father was king what’s that sound
sansa heard it too floating through the woods a kind of wooden clattering snack snack snack i don’t know she said it made her nervous though joffrey let’s go back
i want to see what it is joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds and sansa had no choice but to follow the noises grew louder and more distinct the clack of wood on wood and as they grew closer they heard heavy breathing as well and now and then a grunt
someone’s there sansa said anxiously she found herself thinking of lady wishing the direwolf was with her
you’re safe with me joffrey drew his lion’s tooth from its sheath the sound of steel on leather made her tremble this way he said riding through a stand of trees
beyond in a clearing overlooking the river they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights their swords were wooden sticks broom handles from the look of them and they were rushing across the grass swinging at each other lustily the boy was years older a head taller and much stronger and he was pressing the attack the girl a scrawny thing in soiled leathers was dodging and managing to get her stick in the way of most of the boy’s blows but not all when she tried to lunge at him he caught her stick with his own swept it aside and slid his wood down hard on her fingers she cried out and lost her weapon
prince joffrey laughed the boy looked around wide-eyed and startled and dropped his stick in the grass the girl glared at them sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out and sansa was horrified arya she called out incredulously
go away arya shouted back at them angry tears in her eyes what are you doing here leave us alone
joffrey glanced from arya to sansa and back again your sister she nodded blushing joffrey examined the boy an ungainly lad with a coarse freckled face and thick red hair and who are you boy he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior
mycah the boy muttered he recognized the prince and averted his eyes m’lord
he’s the butcher’s boy sansa said
he’s my friend arya said sharply you leave him alone
a butcher’s boy who wants to be a knight is it joffrey swung down from his mount sword in hand pick up your sword butcher’s boy he said his eyes bright with amusement let us see how good you are
mycah stood there frozen with fear
joffrey walked toward him go on pick it up or do you only fight little girls
she ast me to m’lord mycah said she ast me to
sansa had only to glance at arya and see the flush on her sister’s face to know the boy was telling the truth but joffrey was in no mood to listen the wine had made him wild are you going to pick up your sword
mycah shook his head it’s only a stick m’lord it’s not no sword it’s only a stick
and you’re only a butcher’s boy and no knight joffrey lifted lion’s tooth and laid its point on mycah’s cheek below the eye as the butcher’s boy stood trembling that was my lady’s sister you were hitting do you know that a bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into mycah’s flesh and a slow red line trickled down the boy’s cheek
stop it arya screamed she grabbed up her fallen stick
sansa was afraid arya you stay out of this
i won’t hurt him  much prince joffrey told arya never taking his eyes off the butcher’s boy
arya went for him
sansa slid off her mare but she was too slow arya swung with both hands there was a loud crack as the wood split against the back of the prince’s head and then everything happened at once before sansa’s horrified
